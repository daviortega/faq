Q. When was FLO created and launched?
A. Flow was created and launched in 2013. It is one of the oldest surviving cyrptocurrencities. Its Genesis Block was mined on    June 17, 2013.

Q. I've heard FLO was established via a "fair launch." What does that mean?
A. A "fair launch" means there was no ICO, no premine, and no foundersâ€™ reward.

Q. Why FLO?
A. FLO is used by individuals, corporations, and public entities for a variety of reasons:

   1. floData is accessible and easy to read. You don't need to decompile a smart contract or have a special software to read       it. It's in plaintext on the chain. This helps with auditing and explaining how it works to regulators. Any extra steps       are a barrier to adoption.

   2. floData is easy to write. It is appended to the blockchain using a simple RPC command. This makes maintaining the             software around the solution less costly.

   3. FLO is a fairly launched blockchain with no premine or ICO. Again, this helps for practical regulatory reasons, but also       is a philosophical choice made by those who maintain the software. It guides the decision making for our software and        also allows those implementing it to check off a box they couldn't check using another chain without those features.

  4. FLO is secured by proof of work. This is arguably the best security a network can get, requiring actual buy in of              physical devices and constant operational cost in both manpower and electric power.

  5. FLO has open source software built on top of it (OIP) that can be used for building more advanced applications (this is        how etdb.caltech.edu became a thing).

  6. FLO transactions are cheap and fast. This will always be the case - we will likely increase block size as the network          grows.

  7. FLO's main use-case is floData, unlike other chains who support complex smart contract languages and operations unrelated      to storing data. Sometimes it's best to use a tool that's meant to perform best at a single job rather than bringing          around a Swiss army knife and using it for only 1 of its functions.
  
  Q. Who is using FLO?
  A. FLO is used daily by many individuals and several enterprises including Medici Land Governance (to store land title            registry data), Caltech (to store electron tomography data), tZERO (to store Digital Locate Receipt (DLR) data), and          Alexandria (to assign and mange contents licensing).

  A. Yes. The FLO community can be found here:
